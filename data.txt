1
has spring come
or has the year gone?
second-to-last-day
2
the moon’s your guide:
please come this way
to a traveler’s inn
3
the old-lady cherry
in bloom: a remembrance
of her old age
4
in the capital:
ninety-nine thousand people
blossom viewing
5
the blossoms are seen
even by the eyes of the poor:
demon thistle
6
blue flag irises
looking just like their images
in the water
7
autumn wind
through an open door
a piercing cry
8
withered and bent over,
the whole world upside down:
bamboo in snow
9
withering frost:
melancholy blossoms
through the flower field
10
the faces of blossoms,
do they make you shy?
hazy moon
11
among blossoms:
grieving that I can’t even open
my poem bag
12
blossoming waves:
has snow returned to water,
flowering out of season?
13
like clouds drifting apart,
a wild goose separates, for now,
from his friend
14
a hangover
but while the cherries bloom,
what of it?
15
an acupuncturist
pounding into my shoulder;
the cast off robe
16
Musashi Plain
just an inch,
the deer’s voice
17
on the scales
Kyoto and Edo balanced
in this spring of a thousand years
18
still alive
under my traveler’s hat,
a bit of coolness
19
summer moon
leaving Goyu,
in Akasaka
20
wind from Mt. Fuji
carrying it in my fan,
a souvenir for those in Edo
21
a cat’s trysts
she crosses back and forth
over a crumbling stove
22
summer rains
offering his dragon lights,
the city watchman
23
chopping a tree,
then looking upon the cut end
tonight’s moon
24
passing clouds
like a dog running about and pissing,
scattered winter showers
25
wearing a robe of frost,
the wind spread as its sleeping mat:
an abandoned baby
26
well nothing’s happened
and yesterday’s come and gone!
blowfish soup
27
the Dutch consul too
lies prostrate before Him:
spring of the Shogun’s reign
28
a day of rain
autumn in the world around
Boundary Town
29
the Dutchmen too
have come for the flowers:
the horse saddle
30
on a blue sea,
waves fragrant with rice wine:
tonight’s moon
31
looking around,
gazing intently, beholding:
autumn in Suma
32
morning snow:
onion shoots rising
mark the garden plot
33
ah spring, spring,
great is spring,
etcetera
34
spider, what is it,
in what voice why are you crying?
autumn wind
35
rose of sharon
in the hair of a naked child
a spray of flowers
36
at night, stealthily,
a worm in the moonlight
boring into a chestnut
37
in my humble view
the netherworld must be like this
autumn evening
38
on a withered branch
a crow has settled
autumn evening
39
where’s the winter shower?
with umbrella in hand
the monk returns
40
against the brushwood gate
it sweeps the tea leaves:
windstorm
41
the oars’ sound striking the waves,
a bowel-freezing night 
and tears
42
snow morning:
alone, I manage to chew
dried salmon
43
the rocks withered,
the waters wilted
not even the feeling of winter
44
wake up! wake up!
let’s be friends,
sleeping butterfly
45
butterfly! butterfly!
I would ask you about
China’s haikai
46
even in snow
the noonflower does not wither:
the sun’s light
47
by the noonflower
a rice-pounder cools himself
a sight so moving
48
cuckoo
now there are no
haikai masters
49
white chrysanthemum, 
all that shame with your
long hair, long hair
50
Black Forest:
so now what are you called?
a morning of snow
51
swarming in the waterweeds,
the whitefish: if taken in hand
they would vanish away
52
having planted the basho,
now I despise them:
the reed sprouts
53
cuckoo,
were you invited by the barley
plumed with seed?
54
in summer rains
the crane’s legs
become short
55
foolishly, in the dark,
he grabs a thorn:
hunting fireflies
56
moonflowers white
at night by the outhouse,
torch in hand
57
“live austere and clear!”
Moongazer’s recluse
drinking song
58
banana in a windstorm
a night of listening to rain
dripping in the tub
59
at a poor mountain temple,
a kettle crying in the frost,
the voice frigid
60
ice is bitter
in the mouth of the rat
quenching its thirst
61
the year ending
with echoes of pounding rice cakes
a desolate sleep
62
one who breakfasts
with morning glories:
that’s what I am
63
crescent moon
a morning glory bud at night
swelling
64
wind through his beard,
lamenting late autumn:
who is he?
65
in a world of rain
life is like Sogi’s
temporary shelter
66
my bedclothes are so heavy
perhaps I’ll see the snow
from the sky of Wu
67
New Year’s First Day
deep in thought, lonely
autumn’s evening
68
is the bush warbler
her spirit? asleep,
a lovely willow
69
sing cuckoo:
you’re the Sixth Month’s
plum blossoms
70
the horse ambling,
I see myself in a painting:
summer moor
71
listening to hail
myself, as before,
an old oak
72
the bell fades away,
the blossoms’ fragrance ringing:
early evening
73
eccentric
on grass devoid of fragrance,
a butterfly settles
74
just as I scoop it,
it rings in my teeth:
spring water
75
its sound clear,
echoing to the Northern Stars:
a falling block
76
in the world,
is it harvest time?
my thatched hut
77
spend nights on a journey,
then you’ll know my poems
autumn wind
78
falling blossoms
birds too are startled:
the dust of the koto
79
blooming wildly
among the peach trees:
first cherry blossoms
80
a spring night:
and with dawn on the cherries,
it has ended
81
squeaking in response
to the young sparrows:
mice in their nest
82
this too seems
to be Saigyo’s hut:
a garden of blossoms
83
you too come out, bat:
all these birds amid the blossoms
of this floating world
84
spring rain
blowing back and forth like straw coats,
river willows
85
the fragrance of plums:
carrying me back
to the cold
86
butterflies and birds
ceaselessly fluttering
clouds of blossoms
87
for one who says
“I’m weary of my children”
there are no blossoms
88
cherries in bloom
throughout the world: to them too
“hail Amida Buddha”
89
this mallet
long ago was it a camellia?
a plum tree?
90
not raining, yet
on bamboo-planting day
a raincoat and hat
91
this hut:
even the water rail hasn’t found
your door
92
hydrangeas
at the time for summer clothes
pale blue
93
a squid-seller’s call:
indistinguishable from the
cuckoo’s
94
periodic rain
so no need to worry:
rice sprouts
95
this brushwood hut’s
moon; just as it was
for Amidabo
96
that’s something to see
chrysanthemums after
autumn’s storm
97
as the hackberry fruit falls
the sound of starling wings
morning’s windstorm
98
Japanese lantern plant
fruit, leaves, and shells all
the color of autumn leaves
99
a chrysanthemum drops
its dew, but when I pick it up:
a brood bud
100
my hut:
a square of light
from the window’s moon
101
say something
and the lips go cold:
autumn wind
102
what do they eat
in their tiny house?
autumn in willow’s shade
103
this temple:
a garden full
of banana plants
104
mushroom
it’s become so ragged
it looks like a pine
105
a monkey showman
with a little monkey jacket
on a falling block
106
through the whole night
did the bamboo freeze?
morning frost
107
I’ve hit the bottom
of my bag of discretion:
year’s end
108
winter windstorm
hiding itself in bamboo,
grown still
109
with chrysanthemums gone,
other than the radish
there is nothing
110
my sleeves,
dingy colored and cold:
darkest gray
111
a Motonobu painting:
whence such a sad state?
year’s end
112
these three
of the moon and flowers:
masters of the truth
113
so desirable
inside his satchel,
moon and blossoms
114
Musashino fields
no hindrances now,
your bamboo hat
115
spring begins
in a new year,
ten quarts of old rice
116
are needles falling
in the pine wind?
the water’s cool sound
117
bleached bones
on my mind, the wind pierces
my body to the heart
118
autumn, ten years:
now I point to Edo
as the old home
119
misty rain,
a day with Mt. Fuji unseen:
so enchanting
120
with clouds and mist
in a brief moment a hundred scenes
brought to fulfillment
121
those who listen for the monkeys:
what of this child
abandoned in autumn’s wind?
122
roadside rose of
sharon: devoured
by my horse
123
dozing on my horse,
with dream lingering and moon distant:
smoke from a tea fire
124
month’s end, no moon:
a thousand year cedar
embraced by a windstorm
125
potato-washing women:
were Saigyo here,
he’d compose a waka
126
an orchid’s scent
its incense perfuming
a butterfly’s wings
127
ivy planted,
and four or five stalks of bamboo
in the windstorm
128
should I take it in my hand
it would melt in these hot tears:
autumn frost
129
cotton-beating bow
as consoling as a lute
deep in the bamboos
130
monks, morning glories:
how many died, and reborn;
pine of the dharma
131
a house that knows no winter
the hulling of rice
sounding like hail
132
beat the falling block,
make me hear it
temple wife
133
dew trickles down:
in it I would try to wash away
the dust of the floating world
134
the imperial tomb has stood
for ages: what do you recall,
fern of longing?
135
Yoshitomo’s heart
it does resemble:
autumn wind
136
autumn wind
just thickets and fields
at Fuwa Barrier
137
not dead yet
at journey’s end
autumn evening
138
so harsh
the sound of hail
on my cypress hat
139
winter peonies
and plovers, like
cuckoo in snow
140
daybreak
a whitefish, whiteness
one inch
141
even a horse:
gazing up on it on a
morning of snow
142
even the fern of longing
is withered; buying rice-cakes
at an inn
143
no rain hat
in the winter showers?
well, well!
144
in winter’s winds
don’t I look
just like Chikusai
145
grass for my pillow:
is a dog too being rained on?
night’s voices
146
market townsfolk!
I’ll sell you this hat,
a snow umbrella
147
snow upon snow:
is tonight the twelfth month’s
full moon?
148
the sea darkening,
a wild duck’s call
faintly white
149
the year gone,
still wearing my bamboo hat
and straw sandals
150
whose son-in-law?
bearing fern fronds and rice-cakes
this Year of the Ox
151
a wayfaring crow:
its old nest has become
a plum tree
152
yes it’s spring
through nameless hills,
a faint haze
153
the water drawing
in the frozen night,
the sound of monks’ clogs
154
a wren of a single branch:
the fragrance of its plum blossoms
throughout the world
155
the plums so white:
yesterday did someone steal
the cranes?
156
the dignified stature
of the oak, indifferent
to the blossoms
157
onto my robe
sprinkle dewdrops from
Fushimi’s peach blossoms
158
on a mountain path,
somehow so moving:
wild violets
159
pine of Karasaki:
more vague even
than the blossoms
160
azaleas all arranged:
in their shade, a woman
tearing dried cod
161
in a field of mustard,
with flower-viewing faces:
sparrows
162
our two lives:
between them has lived
this blossoming cherry
163
butterflies only
fluttering in this field
of sunlight
164
blue flag irises
stirring in my mind
a hokku
165
well now, together
let’s eat ears of barley:
a grass pillow
166
yearning for the plum,
bowing before the deutzia:
eyes of tears
167
for the white poppy
it tears off its wing:
the butterfly’s memento
168
from deep in the
peony’s pistils, the bee’s
reluctant parting
169
my journey’s horse
solaced with barley:
a night’s lodging
170
summer robes:
still some lice
I’ve yet to pick
171
clouds now and then
give us a rest:
moonviewing
172
with a full wine cup
I drink to three names
this evening
173
how many frosts
has it endured my banana plant
is my New Year’s pine
174
old fields
off to pick shepherd’s purse blossoms
with male companions
175
looking closely:
a shepherd’s purse blossoming
beneath the hedge
176
overcome with illness,
I can’t even eat a rice cake:
peach blossoms
177
Kannon Temple:
looking off at its tiled roof
in clouds of blossoms
178
the old nest:
so lonely it will be
next door
179
falling to the ground,
returning to the roots:
a flower’s farewell
180
old pond
a frog jumps in,
water’s sound
181
east and west,
the pathos is the same:
autumn wind
182
harvest moon—
wandering round the pond
all night long
183
seeming like
someone blind:
moonviewing
184
just one possession,
my world light
as a gourd
185
dawn comes
even on the night of the 27th,
a crescent moon
186
flowers all withered,
spilling their sadness:
seeds for grass
187
water so cold:
it was hard for even a gull
to fall sleep
188
the water jar cracks:
in the frozen night
I lie awake
189
first snow
great luck to be here
in my own hut
190
first snow
just enough to bend
narciuss leaves
191
drinking sake
and now it’s harder to sleep:
night of snow
192
you start a fire,
I’ll show you something fun:
a great ball of snow
193
“moon and snow”:
so I’ve indulged myself
to the end of the year
194
hey village kids,
leave some plum branches:
ox whips
195
arriving when you were out,
even the plums are far away
beyond the hedge
196
please don’t forget:
in the grove,
a plum blossom
197
at play in the blossoms,
a horsefly: do not eat it
friend sparrow
198
nesting storks:
viewed through branches
of blossoms
199
clouds of blossoms;
the temple bell:
Ueno? Asakusa?
200
all the long day
singing, singing, yet not enough:
a skylark
201
mid the plain
attached to nothing,
the singing skylark
202
cuckoo:
singing singing as it flies,
so very busy
203
my hair grown out,
my face pale:
summer rains
204
in the summer rains
I’ll go view the floating nest
of a grebe
205
now look at me
in this fine summer robe!
a cicada kimono
206
I’ll fall asleep drunk,
the wild pinks blooming
over the rocks
207
you who raised melons:
“would that you were here”
in the evening coolness
208
a little crab
creeping up my leg:
clear water
209
lightning
clenched in the hand:
torchlight in the dark
210
morning glory:
even when painted poorly,
it has pathos
211
field of bush clovers
be their shelter for a night:
mountain dogs
212
in the half harvested
rice paddies, a crane
autumn in the village
213
peasant boy
husking rice, he pauses
to gaze at the moon
214
taro leaves
awaiting the moon
on the village’s burnt field
215
the moon swift,
the branches still holding
the rain
216
sleeping at a temple,
reverent, with my true face:
moon viewing
217
this pine sprouted
in the age of the gods
so holy an autumn
218
bagworms:
come hear their cry;
a thatched hut
219
rising again,
the chrysanthemums faint
after the rains
220
emaciated and yet
somehow the chrysanthemum
buds out
221
“wayfarerer”
will be my name;
first winter showers
222
is one ridge
clouded with winter showers?
Fuji in snow
223
to the capital,
half the sky left
clouds of snow
224
 “gaze into
the darkness of Star Cape”:
is this the plovers’ cry?
225
so cold and yet
a night sleeping together:
so delightful
226
burning pine needles
to dry my hand towel:
the cold
227
winter sun
frozen on horseback,
my shadow
228
may it be snow and sand
you fall into from your horse:
drunk on sake
229
a lone hawk:
finding it brings such joy
at Cape Irago
230
Cape Irago:
nothing can match
the hawk’s cry
231
more than dream
the hawk of reality
heartens me
232
plum and camellia:
praise to their early bloom
here in Hobi Village
233
freshly polished,
the sacred mirror too is clear:
blossoms of snow
234
smoothing it out,
I’m off to snowviewing:
my paper robe
235
well then,
let’s go snow-viewing
till we all fall down
236
Hakone Pass:
someone seems to be crossing it
this morning of snow
237
searching out the plum fragrance
I gaze up at the eaves
of the warehouse
238
the dew frozen,
I soak it dry with my brush:
the pure water spring
239
resting on my journey,
I watch the year-end housecleaning
of the floating world
240
if only I had walked
Walking-stick Hill:
falling from my horse
241
my native home
weeping over my umbilical cord
at year’s end
242
through gaps in snow,
pale purple,
sprouts of the udo
243
I’d like to sleep
borrowing the scarecrow’s clothes—
midnight frost
244
on the second day
I won’t fail:
flowering spring
245
spring has risen
only nine days now and
these fields and mountains!
246
even the heart of Akokuso
I do not know:
plum blossoms
247
give forth your fragrance!
on a coal mining hill,
plum blossoms
248
even the sound
of someone blowing his nose:
plum blossoms
249
withered grass
faint heat waves
one or two inches high
250
sixteen foot Buddha:
heat waves rising
from the stone base
251
from what tree’s
blossoms I know not:
such fragrance
252
the shrine maidens:
the loveliness of the lone plum here
in blossom
253
inside the shop curtains,
in the quiet depths,
plum blossoms of the north
254
out from an old plum tree
grows a young sprout
plum blossoms
255
first I’ll ask
the names of things: these reeds
with new leaves
256
the taro is planted,
the gate covered with vines’
new leaves
257
of this mountain’s
many sorrows, tell the tales
old yam diggers
258
don’t drop your dirt
into my wine cup
flock of swallows
259
my paper robe is wet,
but I’ll go break a branch:
blossoms in the rain
260
inside the shrine’s fences
so unexpected this portrait
of Buddha entering nirvana
261
be naked?
not yet, with second month’s
windstorm
262
the first cherries blooming:
right now, today,
is such a fine day
263
so many many
memories come to mind:
cherry blossoms
264
blossoms as my lodging
from beginning to end
twenty days
265
the Yoshino cherries
I will show you:
cypress hat
266
spring night
someone in retreat, so mysterious
in a corner of the temple
267
higher than the lark:
resting in the sky
at the pass
268
the blossoms at Dragon’s Gate:
a splendid souvenir
for my drinking friends
269
I’ll tell my drinking friends
of these blossoms hanging
over the waterfall
270
in the shade of blossoms
it seems like a No play:
a journey’s rest
271
with a fan
drinking sake in the shadows
falling cherry blossoms
272
were my voice good,
I’d chant from the No :
falling cherry blossoms
273
petal after petal
mountain roses flutter down:
the sound of the rapids
274
cherry blossom viewing:
admirable it is to walk
ten or twelve miles a day
275
with the sun darkening
on the blossoms, it is lonely
a false cypress
276
spring rain
flowing down the tree:
the pure water spring
277
beginning to melt,
I soak it dry with my brush:
the pure water spring
278
blossoms at their peak,
with the mountains as always
at daybreak
279
all the more I’d like to see it
with dawn coming to the blossoms:
the face of the god
280
for my father and mother
I yearn so deeply
a pheasant’s cry
281
departing spring
I’ve finally caught up with it
here at Wakanoura.
282
removing a one layer
I carry it over my shoulder:
clothes-changing day
283
Buddha’s birthday:
on this day is born
a little fawn
284
with a young leaf
I would wipe the tears
from your eyes
285
deer horns
developing their first branch:
our separation
286
travel weary,
just as I finally find lodging
wisteria blossoms
287
villagers sing
verses in the rice fields:
the capital
288
iris blossoms:
conversations about them are
one joy of the journey
289
the moon is here
yet there seems an absence:
summer in Suma
290
seeing the moon
yet something is lacking
summer in Suma
291
the faces of the fishers
were seen first
poppy flowers
292
is it crying from an arrow
from the fishers of Suma?
cuckoo
293
Temple of Suma
hearing the unblown flute
in the deep shade of trees
294
cuckoo:
off where it disappears
a single island
295
octopus traps
fleeting dreams under
summer’s moon
296
in the summer rains
one thing unhidden
the bridge of Seta
297
these fireflies,
like the moon
in all the rice paddies
298
held in my eye:
with Yoshino’s blooms
Seta’s fireflies
299
falling from
a grass blade, and flying away:
a firefly
300
summer in the world:
floating on the lake
over waves
301
moonflowers
and in autumn,
various gourds
302
noonflower,
with a short night’s sleep:
daytime
303
and now also
the clothes of the deceased
summer airing
304
I would lodge here
until the days the goosefoot
has grown a staff
305
mountain cove
I would nourish my body
with this field of melons
306
I would compare them
to a delicate child: flowers
of a summer field
307
a temple bell too
seems to be ringing:
cicada’s cry
308
castle ruins
pure water from the old well
is what I’ll seek first
309
so fascinating,
but then, so sad:
cormorant fishing boat
310
in this place
all that meets the eye
is cool
311
summer has come
yet just one leaf on
the one-leaf-fern
312
like nothing
it’s been compared to:
the crescent moon
313
after the reaping
from the side of a field of early rice
a snipe’s call
314
such a fine house
out back, sparrows delight
in the millet field
315
early autumn
the ocean and the rice fields
all one green
316
weary of the journey,
how many days like today?
autumn’s wind
317
lotus pond
left as they are, unplucked,
for the Festival of Spirits
318
With millet and grass
not a thing wanting:
grass-thatched hut
319
deep into autumn
a butterfly sipping
chrysanthemum dew
320
not hidden
at this house: vegetable soup
with red pepper
321
seeing you off,
your back in the distance
lonely autumn wind
322
seeing friends off,
being seen off, and now:
autumn in Kiso
323
so many plants,
each with its own
brilliant blossom
324
morning glories
oblivious to all the drinking
are in full bloom
325
trembling, teetering,
now even more dew-like
lady flowers
326
its inside I’d like
to line with lacquer:
moon at the inn
327
the hanging bridge
grasping for dear life,
ivy vines
328
high hanging bridge
what first comes to mind
is the Meeting with the Horses
329
her face
an old woman weeping alone:
moon as companion
330
moon of the sixteenth
and still I linger here
near Sarashina
331
biting deep within,
the pungent radish:
autumn wind
332
chestnuts of Kiso:
for those of the floating world,
my souvenir
333
the moon’s light
four gates, four sects
yet only one
334
blowing away
the rocks: Asama’s
autumn windstorm
335
the sixteenth night moon?
or is it this morning’s lingering
chrysanthemums?
336
emaciated in Kiso
and still not recovered:
late harvest moon
337
the ivy leaves
are tinged with the past:
autumn foliage
338
departing autumn
wrapping my body
in the narrow bedding
339
chrysanthemums and
cockscombs: every flower cut
for Nichiren’s death day
340
winter seclusion:
again I’ll lean back against
my old post
341
five or six of us
lined up before the tea cakes:
the sunken hearth
342
I long to imagine
how you looked your staff
of withered wood
343
lying down,
the futon pulled up:
cold, desolate night
344
do they extinguish even
the banked charcoal?
the sound of hissing tears
345
that snow we saw:
this year also
has it fallen?
346
off to buy rice
with a snow covered bag
my winter hood
347
are you a companion
to these creepers secluded away?
winter vegetable seller
348
New Year’s Day:
it’s the sun in each field
that brings such longing
349
so enticing
in the spring of this year too
the sky of wayfaring
350
morning and evening,
as if someone waits for me at Matsushima:
my unfulfilled love
351
heat waves
shimmering from the shoulders
of my paper robe
352
red-blossom plums
unseen love engendered
by the courtly blind
353
doubt it not:
the blossoms of the tide also show
spring upon this bay
354
even the creepers:
their new leaves lovely
at the dilapidated house
355
a skylark’s singing,
and keeping to its rhythm,
a pheasant’s cry
356
no moon, no blossoms,
just drinking sake
all alone
357
a grass hut too
has a season of moving:
a doll’s house
358
young sweetfish
seeing off the whitefish:
departure
359
departing spring
birds cry, in the fishes’
eyes are tears
360
with threads of
heat waves it is interwoven:
the smoke
361
the sun about to sink,
and the threading heat waves
departing
362
a village where no
bells ring: what, then,
of spring evenings?
363
the sunset bell too
cannot be heard:
spring evening
364
so holy:
green leaves, young leaves,
in sun’s light
365
for a while
secluded at a waterfall
start of the summer retreat
366
a man carrying fodder:
I’ll make him our guide
across this summer field
367
mountains too
move into the garden
a summer parlor
368
even woodpeckers
don’t damage this hut:
summer grove
369
rice fields and barley
and among them also
summer’s cuckoo
370
in the summer mountains
praying before the clogs:
setting off
371
a crane cries
that shriek will surely tear
the banana leaves
372
across the plain,
turn my horse over there!
cuckoo
373
falling from high above
at a Takaku lodging,
cuckoo
374
the stench of the stone
the summer grass red,
the scorching dew
375
a whole rice paddy
planted I depart
from the willow
376
from the west? from the east?
above all in the rice sprouts
the sound of the wind
377
the beginning of all art
in the deep north
a rice-planting song
378
people of the world
don’t discern this blossom
chestnut by the eaves
379
summer rains:
enough water to drown
the waterfall
380
planting seedlings
with the hands ancient patterns
from the fern of longing
381
satchel and sword, too,
displayed for Fifth Month:
carp streamers
382
since the cherries bloomed,
I’ve longed to see this pine: two trunks
after three month’s passage
383
Rainhat Island
where is it this rainy month
along muddy roads?
384
I’ll bind blue flags
around my feet:
sandal cords
385
islands and islands
shattered into a thousand pieces,
summer’s sea
386
summer grass:
all that remains
of warriors’ dreams
387
all the summer rains:
have they left it untouched?
Hall of Light
388
fleas, lice,
a horse peeing
by my pillow
389
making coolness
my lodging:
lying at ease
390
crawl out here!
under the silkworm nursery,
the croak of a toad
391
eye-brow brushes
come to mind:
safflower blossoms
392
stillness
sinking into the rocks,
cicadas’ cry
393
gathering all
the summer rains, the swift
Mogami River
394
at this water’s source
I would seek for an ice house:
willow tree
395
the wind’s fragrance
also suggests the south:
Mogami River
396
so grateful
perfumed with snow,
the South Valley
397
coolness
the crescent moon faint
over Black Feather Mountain
398
cloud peaks,
how many have crumbled away:
Moon Mountain
399
at Yudono,
forbidden to speak,
my sleeves wet with tears
400
his jewel-like spirit
it returns to Mt. Haguro,
moon of the law
401
moon? blossoms?
to such questions,
just four sleepers snoring
402
surprising freshness
after departing the mountains of Dewa,
the first eggplant
403
thrusting the hot sun
into the sea:
Mogami River
404
Kisagata
in the rain, Xi Shi asleep,
silk tree blossoms
405
clearing at evening
cooling off under the cherry flowers
with blossoms on the waves
406
the Shallows
a crane with legs wet,
the sea cool
407
Mount Atsumi
all the way to Fuku Bay,
the evening cool
408
the Seventh Month
even the sixth night
is different
409
stormy sea
stretching out over Sado,
Heaven’s River
410
in your medicinal garden
which flowers should be
my night’s pillow?
411
skewering sea breams
with cool willow twigs
a fisherman’s wife
412
in the same house
prostitutes, too, slept:
bush clover and moon
413
the scent of early rice
cutting through the fields, on the right,
the Rough Shore Sea
414
so red, red,
the sun relentless and yet
autumn’s wind
415
autumn is cool:
let each hand set to peeling
melons and eggplants
416
grave too move!
my wailing voice:
autumn wind
417
a lovely name
Little Pine, where the wind wafts
over bush clover and miscanthus
418
drenched passersby
they too are captivating:
bush clover in rain
419
so pitiful
under the helmet,
a cricket
420
Yamanaka
no need to pluck chrysanthemums:
the fragrance of these springs
421
peach tree,
don’t let your leaves fall:
autumn wind
422
by the fishing fires,
a bullhead under the waves
choking in tears
423
leaving the hot-springs:
tonight my skin
will be cool
424
leaving the hot springs,
looking back how many times 
beneath the mist
425
from this day forth
the inscription washed away
by dew on my hat
426
whiter than
the stones of Stone Mountain:
autumn’s wind
427
I would sweep the garden
before departing: in the temple,
falling willow leaves
428
scribbled on,
now the fan is torn up:
memories at departure
429
Asamutsu
on a moon-viewing journey
a dawn departure
430
behold the moon!
while the reeds at Jewel Bay
are still uncut
431
tomorrow’s moon:
does it augur rain?
Hinagadake
432
is this the mountain
where Yoshinaka awoke?
a moon of sorrow
433
the eight scenes
of various provinces and now
the moon at Kei
434
the moon so pure
on the sand carried here
by the Pilgrim Priests
435
harvest moon
the north country weather
so uncertain
436
where’s the moon?
the temple bell sunk
to the bottom of the sea
437
not just the moon:
because of rain, even sumo¯
has been called off
438
the ancient name
“Deer Antler” so lovely:
the autumn moon
439
loneliness
superior even than Suma,
autumn on this beach
440
between the waves
mingling with tiny shells,
bits of bush clover blossoms
441
drop your little petals,
bush clover, on the little shells:
our little cup
442
still not a butterfly
as autumn deepens:
a rape worm
443
just as it is
not even needing the moon:
Mt. Ibuki
444
peacefully secluded here,
I would love to pick fruit
and the grains of grass
445
bloom quickly,
the ninth is near:
chrysanthemum blossoms
446
wisteria beans:
I’ll make them my poetry
with the blossoms gone
447
hermitage
moon, chrysanthemums,
and an acre of rice
448
Saigyo’s sandals:
hang them as well
with the pine’s dew
449
like a clam from its shell,
setting off for Futami:
departing autumn
450
moon, be lonely
I want to tell of
Akechi’s wife
451
for holiness,
everyone’s been shoving each other:
the Shrine Renewal
452
autumn winds:
now the graveyard of Ise
is even more desolate
453
Saigyo’s inkstone?
I pick it up dew
on the concave rock
454
entering the gate:
by the sago palm,
an orchid’s fragrance
455
transforming itself
every single day:
a cotton rose
456
first winter shower:
even the monkey seems to want
a little straw coat
457
for the people in this house
send down winter showers
no matter the cold
458
mushroom gathering
in danger of getting drenched in
a cold evening shower
459
winter garden
the moon too a thread:
an insect’s song
460
on a folding screen
a mountain is painted:
winter seclusion
461
in the first snow
let’s make beards
from rabbit fur
462
hey kids!
let’s run around
in the hail!
463
first snow
for the Great Buddha, when
will the columns be raised?
464
off to the mountain castle
of Ide, hiring a palanquin:
early winter showers
465
were they walking
around Chosho’s grave too?
bowl beating
466
if it hails
I’ll cook and serve
wicker-caught whitebait
467
why does it head
to the market at year’s-end?
a flying crow
468
the man wearing
a straw mat, who is he?
blossoms of spring
469
let’s go see
the Festival of the Otter:
deep in the hills of Seta
470
a bush warbler
drops its hat:
camellia blossom
471
spring rain
just beginning to sprout,
eggplant seedlings
472
this tiny seed
I do not belittle:
red pepper
473
seed potatoes
with cherries blooming,
the vegetable seller on his rounds
474
pine-filled berms
and blossoms a manor built
deep in the forest
475
beneath a tree,
both soup and fish salad:
cherry blossoms!
476
so fitting
bean-flour rice balls
while blossom hunting
477
heat waves
the saiko’s threadlike leaves
in a thin haze
478
butterfly wings:
how many times fluttering
over the wall’s roof
479
the whole village:
are they all descendants
of the blossom guards?
480
“it eats snakes”
hearing this, how ghastly
the call of the pheasant
481
from the four directions,
blossoms are blowing in:
waves of the grebe
482
spring departs:
with those of Omi
I join the lament
483
the solitary nun
aloof in her straw hut:
white azalea
484
daybreak:
in the lingering lavender
a cuckoo calls
485
for now I’ll rely
on the pasania tree:
summer grove
486
you’re the butterfly
I’m Zhuangzi’s
dreaming heart
487
summer grass
before you come,
I’ll hunt out the snakes
488
neither to evening
nor morning does it belong:
melon blossom
489
the sun’s path
hollyhocks turn with it
in summer rains
490
fragrant orange
when? in what field?
cuckoo
491
firefly viewing
the boatman is drunk,
the boat unsteady
492
in the capital,
yet longing for the capital
cuckoo
493
river breeze
wearing pale persimmon robes,
the evening cool
494
don’t take after me:
cut in two,
a musk melon
495
my hut:
that the mosquitoes are small
is all I can offer
496
soon to die,
yet no sign of it:
a cicada’s cry
497
do not peek
even through silk tree leaves:
the stars’ light
498
Festival of Spirits:
today too at the crematorium
smoke rises
499
dragonfly
unable to hold on
to the grass blade
500
wild boars too
are blown along:
autumn windstorm
501
turn this way,
I too am lonely:
autumn evening
502
plucking out white hairs
under the pillow,
a cricket
503
harvest moon
children lined up along
the temple veranda
504
harvest moon
turning toward the sea,
the Seven Komachis
505
moonviewing
in the room not a single
beautiful face
506
the moon about to rise
everyone with hands on knees
in the room
507
by a paulownia tree,
a quail is crying
inside the garden wall
508
lightning,
yet unenlightened:
so admirable
509
a sick goose
falling in the night’s cold:
sleep on a journey
510
a fisher’s hut:
mingling with small shrimp,
crickets
511
sipping morning tea,
the monk is peaceful:
chrysanthemum blossoms
512
a butterfly too comes
to sip the vinegar:
chrysanthemum salad
513
early winter showers
enough to blacken the fields’
freshcut stubble
514
a cricket
crying forgetfully:
the brazier
515
frost has come,
but a wild pink blossom
on the wooden brazier
516
winter winds
cheeks swollen in pain,
someone’s face
517
first snow
the color of the knapsack
of a wandering priest
518
snow falling
miscanthus for the shrine hut
still uncut
519
plovers rising:
as early evening deepens,
winds storm down Mt. Hiei
520
year-end house cleaning:
through the cedar trees,
a windstorm
521
for half a day,
companions to the gods
seeing the year off
522
dried salmon and also
a Kuya pilgrim’s emaciation:
the depths of winter
523
hold for a moment
the sound of slicing soybeans:
bowl beating
524
flying down
on the stones of Stone Mountain:
hail storm
525
usually hateful,
yet the crow too
in this dawn snow
526
on low hills too:
a mountain windstorm swirling
the tree leaves
527
on Hira and Mikami
snow mantles across the peaks:
a bridge of snowy egrets
528
so admirable
even on a day without snow,
straw coat and bamboo hat
529
hidden
in the late winter waters:
a diving grebe
530
buying a house,
and lending it to me:
seeing the year off
531
Kiso’s character:
sprouting strongly through the snow,
the spring grass
532
plum blossoms and fresh greens
at the Mariko stopover
and that yam porridge
533
mountain village
and the New Year’s dancers are late:
plum blossoms
534
moonrise gathering
carrying a plum branch,
a novice mountain ascetic
535
so lazy
finally roused from bed:
spring rain
536
emaciated
by love and barley?
the lady cat
537
year upon year
fertilizing the cherry trees:
blossom dust
538
drinking it all up,
let’s make it into a flower vase:
the four liter wine barrel
539
for a moment
it hangs above the blossoms:
the night’s moon
540
old and infirm
my teeth bite sand
in the dried seaweed
541
a mountain rose
I should stick it in my hat
just like a branch
542
mountain roses
when tea ovens at Uji
are so fragrant
543
a night of darkness
having lost its nest,
a plover crying out
544
grievous junctures
the human fate of becoming
a bamboo shoot
545
Arashiyama’s
bamboo grove so dense
the wind threading through
546
citron blossoms
let’s recall the olden days:
the food preparing room.
547
cuckoo:
filtering through the vast bamboo grove
the moon’s light
548
sunk in sorrow,
make me feel loneliness:
mountain cuckoo
549
clapping hands,
and dawnlight in the echo:
summer moon
550
bamboo shoots
and my childhood
sketches of them
551
ears of barley
tinted in the tears
of crying skylarks
552
day by day
the barley reddens toward ripeness:
singing skylarks
553
devoid of talent,
I wish only to sleep:
raucous warblers
554
summer rains
poem cards peeled off,
their traces on the wall
555
wrapping rice dumplings:
with one hand she puts back
her fallen hair
556
Sixth Month:
the burning heat of someone
suffering from flu
557
early autumn
the rolled up mosquito net
now a bedcover
558
a begonia,
the color of watermelon blossoms,
in full bloom
559
autumn’s wind blowing
and yet how green
the chestnut burs
560
seedhead of the reed
seized by demons
of the Rashomon gate
561
in the cowshed,
the dusky sound of mosquitoes:
lingering summer heat
562
the color of autumn:
not even a pot
of rice-bran mash
563
loneliness
dangling from a nail,
a cricket
564
friends who’ve given rice:
tonight they’re my guest
at moonviewing
565
Mii Temple,
I’d love to knock on its gate:
tonight’s moon
566
open the lock
let the moon shine in
Floating Temple
567
how easily it rose
and now it hesitates,
the moon in clouds
568
sixteenth night moon
just enough time to boil shrimp
in the night’s darkness
569
harvest moon:
though it’s a second time .
this moon at Seta
570
rice-field sparrows
in the tea fields
their refuge
571
the hawk’s eyes
have darkened now:
calling quail
572
gaze at the buckwheat, too,
and make them envious:
bushclover in the fields
573
grass-thatched hut
as day darkens I’m given
chrysanthemum wine
574
along the bridge beam
endures the fern of recollection:
farewell moon
575
nine times awakened
yet it’s still the moon
before dawn
576
mushroom
a leaf from an unknown tree
sticking to it
577
beneath the noodles
building up the fire:
the night’s cold
578
autumn wind
a paulownia tree being blown,
now frost on the ivy
579
rice threshing,
an old woman’s good fortune:
chrysanthemum blossom
580
the ambience
of a hundred years: this garden’s
fallen leaves
581
so very precious:
are they tinting my tears?
falling crimson leaves
582
finely-crafted,
now the garden is enlivened:
early winter shower
583
deep-rooted leeks
washed pure white:
so cold
584
time to time
gazing on Mt. Ibuki:
winter seclusion
585
has the withering wind
added some color?
a bloom out of season
586
narcissus
and the white paper screen,
reflecting each other
587
its color
whiter than the peach:
narcissus bloom
588
weary of the capital,
ah this cold whipping wind
winter dwelling
589
awaiting the snow,
the faces of the wine lovers
lightning flash
590
winter winds blow
the rocks sharpened
among the cedars
591
praying for a warm bed,
it has now appeared:
sleep along the journey
592
putting up at an inn
I am asked my name:
early winter showers
593
somehow
still alive snow on
withered miscanthus
594
the gods gone
everything desolate among
the dead leaves
595
arrowroot leaves
with their face exposed:
morning frost
596
geese clamoring
on rice fields at Toba
frigid rain
597
fishes, birds,
their heart we do not know:
seeing the year off
598
a spring unseen:
on the back of a mirror,
plum blossoms
599
so enviable:
far north of the floating world,
mountain cherry blossoms
600
bush warbler
pooping on the rice cake
at the edge of the veranda
601
know my heart:
with a blossom,
a begging bowl
602
cats in love:
when it’s over, from the bedroom
a hazy moon
603
counting them as I pass:
house after house,
the plums and willows
604
in my two hands,
peach and cherry blossoms
and mugwort rice-cake
605
the sound of a
cuckoo singing
an old inkstone box
606
cuckoo cries
five-foot spears
of blue flags
607
Sixth Month
though there is sea bream,
this pickled whale meat
608
on the Chinese gable,
the setting sun growing faint:
evening cool
609
they make me forget
the heat of summer’s pinks:
wildflowers of the fields
610
under the crescent moon
the earth is shrouded with mist:
buckwheat blossoms
611
banana leaves
will hang by the pillars:
moon over the hut
612
harvest moon
swelling up to my gate,
the cresting tide
613
green was just right
and yet now it’s a
a red pepper
614
upriver and
now downriver
moon’s companion
615
traveling with autumn
I would go all the way to
Komatsu River
616
autumn departs
yet something holds promise
green tangerines
617
just today,
let’s all be old:
first winter shower
618
opening the hearth
the aging plasterer
with sideburns of frost
619
salted sea breams,
their gums too are cold:
the fish store
620
sweeping the garden,
the snow forgotten:
a broom
621
banked charcoal
against the wall,
the guest’s shadow
622
into my moon and flower
folly, I’ll drive a needle:
start of deep winter
623
my heart
so oddly at ease:
Twelfth Month
624
year after year
the monkey wearing
a monkey’s mask
625
slowly spring
is taking shape:
moon and plum
626
a whitefish
opening its black eyes
in the net of the Law
627
on this First Horse Day,
a fox must have shaved
your head
628
a crane’s black
robe of feathers
clouds of blossoms
629
cuckoo
its call stretching out
across the water
630
going beyond even
the art of wind and moon:
peony blossoms
631
emulate the heart
of a wayfarer:
pasania blossoms
632
learn from the journey
of a sorrowing wayfarer:
flies of Kiso
633
moonflower
sticking my drunken face
out the window
634
children!
noonflowers have bloomed,
and I’ll peel a melon
635
with flooding waters
the stars too sleep on their journey
upon a rock
636
without dropping
its bright white dew,
a bush clover sways
637
first mushroom
just a few days into the season,
autumn dew
638
morning glories
locked during daytime,
my fence gate
639
morning glories
even they, too, are not
my friend
640
fish stench:
on top of waterweed
dace entrails
641
sixteenth night moon
ever so slightly
the darkening begins
642
in autumn’s wind,
sadly broken,
a mulberry staff
643
have you seen it?
on the seventh night, over your grave,
the third-day moon
644
the moon has set;
all that remains is
the four corners of his desk
645
chrysanthemums blooming
in a stonemason’s yard
amid the stones
646
on the gold screen
a pine of great age
winter seclusion
647
chrysanthemum fragrance
in the garden, the sole
of a worn-out sandal
648
winter chrysanthemums
rice bran spilling over them
from a nearby hand mill
649
winter chrysanthemum
heating sweet wine
in front of the window
650
wrapped warm
in its feather robe,
the duck’s feet
651
up in the saddle
sits a little boy
radish harvest
652
first snow
coating the bridge
under construction
653
a samurai gathering:
pungent as a radish is
their talk
654
the pathos of
the birdseller’s geese:
Festival of Ebisu
655
Ebisu Festival:
vinegar salesman decked out
in formal wear
656
everyone heads off,
grateful for the bridge:
frosted roadway
657
still alive
all frozen into one:
sea slugs
658
year-end housecleaning:
hanging his own shelf,
a carpenter
659
and also a night
a thief came calling:
year’s end
660
decorations of the immortals:
I’d love to hear from Ise
the first news of the year
661
in the plum’s fragrance,
suddenly the sun
mountain path
662
as if touching
a boil, willow branches
bending
663
bush warbler
behind the willow,
in front of the grove
664
in the plum’s fragrance
the single term “the past”
holds such pathos
665
Buddha’s Nirvana Day 
wrinkled hands together,
the sound of the rosaries
666
forty or fifty feet
in the sky, raindrops
in the willow
667
spring rain
dripping down the wasp’s nest
from the leaking roof
668
a green willow
drooping into mud:
low tide
669
spring rain
mugwort spreading out
among the roadside grass
670
this dew isn’t cold
the nectar of a
peony blossom
671
hidden in the bushes,
do the tea-pickers too hear it?
cuckoo
672
deutzia
over it, dark, a willow
bending back
673
hydrangea
and a thicket as a little garden
for the cottage
674
ears of barley
clutched for support:
bidding farewell
675
especially when
it comes into view
Fuji in Fifth Month
676
bush warbler
in a grove of bamboo shoots
singing its old age
677
summer rains
a silkworm ill
in the mulberry field
678
Suruga road
orange blossoms too
have the scent of tea
679
summer rains:
blow that sky down,
Oi River
680
on a journey through the world,
tilling a small field,
back and forth
681
for coolness
this Hida craftsman
has the blueprint
682
 “the water rail calls there”
people say, and so
staying over at Saya
683
coolness
naturally, the branches
of a wild pine
684
having carried brushwood,
the horse returns
wine casks for rice-planting
685
coolness
portrayed in painting:
bamboos of Saga
686
clear cascade stream
has its water been drawn up
for these jelly noodles?
687
Sixth Month
the clouds laid out on its peak,
Windstorm Mountain.
688
clear cascade stream 
falling into the waves,
green pine needles
689
in morning dew,
dirty and cool,
a mud-smeared melon
690
At Kyokusui’s house
summer night
at dawn, scattered leftovers
of chilled food
691
fanning the rice,
his wife prepares a special treat
the cool of evening
692
plates and bowls too
faint in twilight:
evening cool
693
as autumn approaches
our hearts are drawn together
a four-and-a-half mat room
694
lightning
through the face,
miscanthus plumes
695
so cool:
feet against a wall
in a midday nap
696
a narrow path,
wire grass blossoms
filled with dew
697
tanabata
autumn is truly here
as night begins
698
the whole family
white-haired, leaning on canes:
a graveyard visit
699
do not think
you did not count:
Festival of Spirits
700
lightning
into the darkness
a night-heron’s cry
701
the color of the wind
planted wild,
the garden in autumn
702
a village grown old:
no house without
a persimmon tree
703
winter melons
all of them now
with changed faces
704
under the harvest moon,
mist at the foot of the mountains
haze over the rice paddies
705
seeming to be
blossoms of the harvest moon:
cotton field
706
cockscombs
with geese arriving,
now deeper crimson
707
may the hokku that come
be unlike our faces:
first cherry blossoms
708
new rice-straw
is appearing with
early winter showers
709
I’ll serve buckwheat
while they’re blossoming:
mountain path
710
departing autumn
with their hands outspread,
chestnut burs
711
crying “beep” 
the lingering sound so sad:
night deer
712
chrysanthemums’
fragrance in Nara, many
ancient Buddhas
713
in the scent of chrysanthemums,
climbing through the dark
at festival time
714
penetrating even
the lair of a wild boar
cricket’s cry
715
buying a measuring box
I then changed my mind:
moonviewing
716
autumn already passing:
in the cold drizzle
a waning moon
717
autumn’s night
has been struck and shattered:
a genial conversation
718
this road
with no one on it,
autumn dusk
719
wind in the pines
swirling round the eaves
as autumn ends
720
this autumn:
why do I feel so old?
into the clouds, a bird
721
white chrysanthemum:
gazing closely,
not a speck of dust
722
the moon is clear
accompanying my boy lover
frightened by a fox
723
deepening autumn:
the man next door,
what does he do?
724
ill on a journey:
my dreams roam round
over withered fields
1
winter warbler;
long ago in Wang Wei's
hedge also
2
A kite floats
At the place in the sky
Where it floated yesterday.
3
Coolness!
The sound of the bell
Leaving the bell.
4
Grasses are misty,
The waters silent 
A tranquil evening.
5
Misty grasses,
Quiet waters,
It's evening.
6
blowing from the west
fallen leaves gather
in the east
7
The slow day; 
a pheasant 
settles on the bridge
8
The sparrow is singing, 
its small mouth 
open.
9
Caught in a sudden shower
Huddling sparrows
Vie to get at the grass leaves.
10
An evening cloudburst 
sparrows cling desperately 
to trembling bushes
11
Waterfowls.
One lantern comes out 
of the castle.
12
With the evening breeze,
The water laps against
The heron's legs.
13
evening wind
water laps
the heron's legs
14
Evening breeze 
water is slapping against the legs 
of a blue heron.
15
A gust of wind
Whitens
The water birds.
16
Tears
For the wild geese of Sosho;
A hazy moon.
17
a sudden squall
and the bird by the water
is turning white
18
A painting for sale
A swallow lets fall a dropping,
As it flies away.
19
The thwack of an ax 
in the heart of a thicket 
and woodpecker's tat-tats!
20
A flying cuckoo, 
over the Heian capital
goes diagonally across the city.
21
For the cuckoo I wait
Here in the capital
Beneath the vain skies of hoping.
22
They end their flight
One by one 
Crows at dusk.
23
A whale!
Down it goes, and more and more
up goes its tail!
24
Bats flitting here and there; 
The woman across the street
Glances this way.
25
the first gleam 
of a new day
on pilchard’s head
26
Dawn 
Fish the cormorants haven't caught
Swimming in the shallows.
27
With the young trout in the valley
a leaf of the dwarf bamboo 
floats away.
28
Leaves some trout,
Knocks, goes on,
The evening gate.
29
the short night ending
close to the water’s edge
a jellyfish
30
A dog barking 
At a peddler:
Peach trees in bloom.
31
Tilling the field
the man who asked the way
has disappeared
32
At sunset
The sound of pheasant shooting
Near the spring mountainside.
33
Plowing the field.
A immobile cloud 
has disappeared.
34
The two plum trees 
I love their blooming!
One early, one later.
35
In the white plum blossoms
Night to next day
Just turning.
36
Darting here and there, 
the bat is exploring 
the moonlit plum
37
Tides of the spring sea,
tide after indolent tide
drifting on and on...
38
In the spring sea
Waves undulating and undulating
All day long.
39
The spring sea rising
And falling, rising
And falling all day.
40
No bridge
And the sun going down 
Spring currents.
41
bags of seeds 
being wetted 
by the spring rain
42
bags of seed
soaked
by spring rain.
43
Rape-flowers;
Not visiting the priest,
but passing by.
44
Hazy moonlight 
someone is standing 
among the pear trees.
45
A woman
Reading a letter by moonlight
Pear blossoms
46
By flowering pear 
and by the lamp of the moon 
she reads her letter
47
The mountain guide 
simply takes no notice
of the cherry blossoms.
48
Not cherry blossoms 
but peach blossom sweetness 
surrounds this little house
49
Drinking up the clouds,
It spews out cherry blossoms 
Yoshino Mountain.
50
With the cherry blossoms gone
The temple is glimpsed
Through twigs and branches.
51
shining on the sea...
dazzling sunlight shaking over
hills of cherry-bloom
52
Pure white plum blossoms 
slowly begin to turn
the color of dawn
53
Plum blossoms in bloom, 
in Kitano teahouse, 
the master of sumo
54
Fallen red blossoms
from plum trees burst into flame 
among the horse turds
55
Having reddened the plum blossoms,
The sunset attacks
Oaks and pines.
56
By moonlight
The blossoming plum
Is a tree in winter.
57
Plum-blossoms everywhere,
I should go south,
I should go north.
58
Plum blossoms here and there 
It's good to go north,
good to go south.
59
riverbank plum-tree
do your reflected blossoms 
really flow away?
60
Spring rain: as yet
the little froglets' bellies
haven't got wet.
61
These morning airs 
one can see them stirring
caterpillar hairs!
62
The year's first poem done, 
with smug self confidence - 
a haikai poet.
63
Longer has become the daytime; 
a pheasant is fluttering down 
onto the bridge.
64
Yearning for the Bygones
Lengthening days, accumulating, 
recalling the days of distant past.
65
Slowly passing days,
with an echo heard here in 
a corner of Kyoto.
66
A day slow in going
Echoes
In the corners of Kyoto.
67
Into a nobleman, 
a fox has changed himself 
early evening of spring.

68The light on a candle stand 
is transferred to another candle 
spring twilight.
69
Lighting one candle 
with another candle; 
an evening of spring.
70
A short nap, 
then awakening this spring day 
has darkened.
71
Who is it for, 
this pillow on the floor, 
in the twilight of spring?
72
The big gateway's 
heavy doors, standing 
in the dusk of spring.
73
With no under robes, 
bare butt suddenly exposed 
a gust of spring wind
74
treading on the tail
of the copper pheasant
the frost of spring
75
Springtime rain 
almost dark, and yet 
today still lingers.
76
Springtime rain 
a little shell on a small beach
enough to moisten it.
77
Springtime rain: together,
intent upon their talking go
straw-raincoat and umbrella.
78
Springtime rain is falling
as a child's rag ball is soaking wet
on the house roof.
79
Spring evening.
To the half dying incense
I add it.
80
The pond and the river
Have become one
In the spring rain.
81
These lazy spring days 
continue but how far away 
those times called Long Ago!
82
Sweet springtime showers 
and no words can express 
how sad it all is
83
Only the shoots 
of new green leaves, white water, 
and yellow barley
84
Along the roadside 
discarded duckweed blossoms 
in the evening rain
85
The camellia tips, 
the remains of last night's rain 
splashing out
86
Someone is living there; 
smoke leaks through the wall, 
in the spring rain.
87
At sunset
The sound of pheasant shootingl
Near the spring mountainside.
88
Coming back
So many pathways
Through the spring grass.
89
No bridge
And the sun going down 
Spring currents.
90
in the clear fording
pale feet of the silent girl
clouding May waters
91
A dog barking 
At a peddler:
Peach trees in bloom.
92
with the noon conch blown 
those old rice-planting songs 
are suddenly gone
93
immobile fuji
alone unblanketed by
millions of new leaves
94
even the ocean 
rising and falling all day
sighing green like trees
95
In the moonlight,
The color and scent of the wisteria
Seems far away.
96
In pale moonlight 
the wisteria's scent 
comes from far away
97
Morning haze:
as in a painting of a dream,
men go their ways.
98
Before the white chrysanthemum
the scissors hesitate
a moment.
99
The air shimmers.
Whitish flight
Of an unknown insect.
100
Within the quietness 
of a lull in visitors' absence
appears the peony flower!
101
Peony petals fell
Piling one upon another
In twos and threes.
102
Peony having scattered
two or three petals lie 
on one another.
103
When a heavy cart 
comes rumbling along 
peonies tremble
104
The rain of May 
facing toward the big river, houses, 
just two of them.
105
A summer river being crossed
how pleasing
with sandals in my hands!
106
Wild roses in bloom  
so like a pathway in
or toward, my home village.
107
With sorrow 
while coming upon the hill 
flowering wild roses.
108
Summer night ending so soon
while on the river shallows 
a sliver of moon remains
109
The short night 
Broken, in the shallows,
A crescent moon.
110
Short summer night.
A dewdrop
On the back of a hairy caterpillar
111
In seasonal rain 
along a nameless river 
fear too has no name
112
A long hard journey, 
rain beating down the clover 
like a wanderer's feet
113
A lightning flash 
the sound of water drops 
falling through bamboo
114
A flash of lightening!
The sound of drops
Falling among the bamboos
115
Rain falls on the grass, 
filling the ruts left by 
the festival cart
116
struck by a
raindrop, snail
closes up
117
That snail 
One long horn, one short,
What's on his mind?
118
White dew 
One drop
On each thorn
119
fresh young leaves 
the sound of a waterfall
both far and near
120
In the summer rain
The path
Has disappeared.
121
On these southern roads, 
on shrine or thatched roof, all the same,
swallows everywhere
122
A mosquito buzzes
Every time flowers 
of honeysuckle fall.
123
buzzing mosquito
each time a honeysuckle flower
falls
124
At the ancient well, 
leaping high for mosquitoes, 
that fish-dark sound
125
An old well 
jumping at a mosquito
the fish's sound is dark
126
old well
leaping for a mosquito
a dark fish sound
127
At a roadside shrine, 
before the stony buddha 
a firefly burns
128
Butterfly in my hand 
As if it were a spirit
Unearthly, insubstantial.
129
Clinging to the bell 
he dozes so peacefully
this new butterfly
130
It pierces me
stepping on the comb of my gone wife
in the bedroom.
131
More than last year, 
I now feel solitude; 
autumn twilight.
132
This being alone 
may even be a kind of happy
autumn dusk.
133
Utter aloneness 
another great pleasure 
in autumn twilight
134
Moon in the sky's top, 
clearly passes through 
this poor town street.
135
This feeling of sadness 
a fishing string being blown 
by the autumn wind.
136
Crossing the autumn moor 
I keep hearing
Someone behind me!
137
In an old pond
A frog ages
While leaves fall.
138
Harvest moon 
Called at his house,
He was digging potatoes.
139
buying leeks
then walking home
under bare trees
140
the peony cut 
nothing remains
in the garden
141
after falling
its image still stands;
the peony flower
142
slung over a screen
a dress of silk and gauze;
autumn breeze
143
autumn breezes 
spin small fish hung to dry 
from beach house eaves
144
the late evening crow 
of deep autumn longing 
suddenly cries out
145
I go out alone 
to visit a man alone 
in this autumn dusk
146
being awake
he says he is already asleep.
autumn chilly night.
147
Goodbye. I will go 
alone down Kiso Road 
old as autumn
148
the harvest moon 
rabbits go scampering
across Lake Suwa
149
Light of the moon
Moves west, flowers' shadows
Creep eastward.
150
calligraphy of geese
against the sky
the moon seals it
151
escaped the nets,
escaped the ropes
the moon on the water
152
head pillowed on arm, 
such affection for myself! 
and this smoky moon
153
moon in midsky
high over the village hovels 
wandering on
154
With a woman friend
bowing at the Great Palace 
a pale hazy moon
155
four or five men dance in a circle
above them the moon
about to drop
156
on the mountain crests
a line of wild geese
and the moon’s seal
157
the beginning of autumn:
what is the fortune teller
looking so surprised at?
158
Mushroom hunting
raising my head
the moon over the peak.
159
winter rain on moss 
soundlessly recalls those 
happy bygone days
160
rain on moss
recalling those happy days
of long ago
161
that handsaw marks time 
with the sound of poverty 
late on a winter night
162
a handsaw is sounding
as if from a poor one
midnight in this winter
163
Blow of an ax,
Pine scent,
The winter woods.
164
Going home
the horse stumbles
in the winter wind.
165
Priestly poverty 
he carves a wooden buddha 
through a long cold night
166
Cover my head 
Or my feet?
The winter quilt.
167
In a bitter wind 
a solitary monk bends 
to words cut in stone
168
Bamboo hat, straw coat 
the very essence of Basho 
falling winter rain
169
Light winter rain 
like scampering rat's-feet 
over my koto
170
Walking on dishes 
the rat's feet make the music 
of shivering cold
171
The ferry departs 
as the tardy man stands in 
the first winter rain
172
Nobly, the great priest 
deposits his daily stool 
in bleak winter fields
173
This cold winter night, 
that old wooden-head buddha 
would make a nice fire
174
The winter moon:
A temple without a gate,
How high the sky!
175
With a runny nose 
sitting alone at the Go board, 
a long cold night
176
A flying squirrel 
munches a small bird's bones 
in a bare winter field
177
the angler 
his dreadful intensity
in the evening rain!
178
Not quite dark yet
And the stars shining
Above the withered fields.
179
Let myself go to bed; 
New Year's Day is only a matter
for tomorrow.
180
Camphor tree roots 
are quietly getting wet, 
in the winter rainy air.
181
Old man's love affair; 
in trying to forget it, 
a winter rainfall.
182
In an old pond, 
a straw sandal is sinking -
it is sleeting.
183
New Year's first poem 
written, now self-satisfied, 
O haiku poet!
184
the stonecutter's chisel
in clear water
cooling
185
grasses wet in the rain,
just after the festival cart 
passed by.
186
to my eyes 
how delightful the fan of my beloved is
in complete white.
187
Young bamboo trees 
at Hashimoto, the courtesan, 
is she still there or not?
188
The owner of the field
Goes to see how his scarecrow is
And comes back.
189
The old calendar
Fills me with gratitude
Like a sutra.
