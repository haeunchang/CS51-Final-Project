1
apples go quickly
bananas wait till they fall
plums get rewarded
2
abelian groups
chained to the dungeon ceiling
cohomology
3
sipping morning tea
around deserted landfill
on the couch crawls snail
4
the first summer breeze
hits my eye like pizza pie
fresh from Chicago
5
nested deep inside
my fear of abandonment
and daddy issues
6
giant shiny screen
computers look so harmless
just to mislead me
7
gong gong gong gong gong
is this someone's wedding or
funeral instead
8
laughter everywhere
making smalltalk, having fun
slowly dying inside
